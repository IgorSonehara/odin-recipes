    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This mildly spiced summer sausage recipe is so easy and yields amazing results. Made with ground beef, mustard seed, garlic powder, black pepper, and liquid smoke flavoring, it makes a great snack when served with crackers and cheese.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mustard seed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons liquid smoke flavoring</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar-based curing mixture (such as Morton® Tender Quick®)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Use your hands to mix ground beef, mustard seed, liquid smoke, curing salt, garlic powder, and pepper together in a large bowl. Form mixture into two equal logs. Wrap logs in aluminum foil with the shiny side facing the meat; refrigerate for 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Use a toothpick to poke small holes through the aluminum foil in the bottom of each log. Place logs onto a broiler rack and fill the broiler pan with 1/2 inch water.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 90 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool for 30 minutes. Refrigerate until fully chilled, about 12 hours, before unwrapping and serving.</li>
    </ol>
